A bite is a short article. Some might say, it's _bite-sized_.
As an example, this is how you would define a class in Python 2 and Python 3 respectively.

```python
# Python 2
class MyClass(object):
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
```

```python
# Python 3
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
```
