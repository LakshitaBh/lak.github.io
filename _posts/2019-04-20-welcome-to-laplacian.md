This theme is based on the beautiful [Lagrange](https://github.com/LeNPaul/Lagrange) theme
by Paul Le. The modifications add some features that I like personally but may not be liked by
everyone. Here is a list of modifications, all of which are taken from the
[Trio](https://github.com/ankur-gupta/trio) theme.

1. Code syntax highlighting theme has been modified
2. A search page has been added
3. Disqus code for comments is updated
4. Comment counts have been added to the index and posts
5. Sharing buttons have been modified
6. Tables have been made easier to read
7. Google Analytics support and search engine optimization has been removed
8. Other minor modifications including code reorganization
